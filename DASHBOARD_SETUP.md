# Dashboard Authentication & Storage Setup

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Form Input Bug

**Problem**: Users could only type one character in input fields before they stopped accepting input.
**Root Cause**: Global keyboard shortcuts (Alt+1-7) were interfering with form inputs.
**Solution**: Added a check to prevent shortcuts from firing when users are typing in input/textarea fields.

### 2. ✅ Image Uploads with Supabase Storage

**Problem**: Project images were handled via raw URLs.
**Solution**: Implemented Supabase Storage bucket integration for project images.

- Added file upload component to ProjectsSection
- Images are uploaded to 'project-images' bucket
- Public URLs are automatically generated and stored

### 3. ✅ Authentication Protection

**Problem**: Dashboard was accessible without authentication.
**Solution**: Added Supabase Auth protection with magic link authentication.

- Protected `/dashboard` and `/api/dashboard` routes with middleware
- Added login page with email magic link authentication
- Added sign-out functionality to dashboard
- Secured API routes with user verification

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @supabase/ssr --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 3. Supabase Storage Setup

Run the SQL commands in `setup-storage.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create the project-images bucket and set up proper RLS policies.

### 4. Test the Changes

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/dashboard` - should redirect to `/login`
3. Enter your email and click "Send Magic Link"
4. Check your email and click the magic link
5. Should redirect to dashboard
6. Test form inputs - should now accept multiple characters
7. Test image upload in Projects section
8. Test sign out functionality

- Server-side user verification in API routes
- Secure cookie-based session management
- RLS policies for storage bucket access

## Testing the Authentication

### To Test If Authentication is Working:

1. **Clear browser storage**: Open browser DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear storage
2. **Go to dashboard**: Visit `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
3. **Expected behavior**: Should redirect to `/login` page
4. **Test login flow**:
      - Enter your email on login page
      - Click "Send Magic Link"
      - Check your email and click the magic link
      - Should redirect back to dashboard

### If Dashboard is Still Accessible:

The authentication system is working but you might already be logged in. To force logout:

1. Go to dashboard
2. Click the "Sign out" button in the top right
3. Should redirect to login page
4. Now try accessing `/dashboard` directly - should redirect to login

### Debug Authentication Status:

Visit `http://localhost:3001/api/debug/auth` to see current auth status and environment variables.

### Image Upload Flow:

1. User selects image file in Projects section
2. File is uploaded to Supabase 'project-images' bucket
3. Public URL is generated and stored in project data
4. Image preview is shown immediately

### Form Input Fix:

The keyboard shortcuts now check if the user is typing in an input field before triggering, preventing the one-character limitation issue.
