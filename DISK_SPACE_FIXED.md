# Disk Space Issue Fixed âœ…

## Problem: ENOSPC - No Space Left on Device

The error `ENOSPC: no space left on device, write` was occurring because:

1. **Disk was full** - Your system ran out of available disk space
2. **Webpack cache buildup** - Next.js cache files were consuming too much space
3. **Build artifacts** - Accumulated build files from multiple compilations

## âœ… Solutions Applied:

### 1. **Cleaned Cache Directories**

```powershell
# Removed Next.js build cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next

# Removed Node.js cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.cache

# Cleaned temporary files
Get-ChildItem -Include "*.log", "*.tmp", "temp*" -Recurse | Remove-Item
```

### 2. **Disabled Development Caching**

Updated `next.config.mjs` to prevent cache buildup:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
	// Disable caching to prevent disk space issues
	webpack: (config, { dev }) => {
		if (dev) {
			config.cache = false;
		}
		return config;
	},
	// ... rest of config
};
```

### 3. **Server Restart**

- Cleared all cached files
- Restarted development server with clean state
- Server now running successfully at http://localhost:3000

## âœ… Status: Fixed

**Development Server**: Running successfully without cache errors
**Disk Space**: Freed up by removing build artifacts
**Future Prevention**: Caching disabled in development mode

## Additional Recommendations:

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically run `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next` to clear cache
2. **Disk Monitoring**: Keep an eye on available disk space
3. **Production**: Re-enable caching for production builds for better performance

Your forms should now work properly without the disk space interference! ðŸŽ¯
